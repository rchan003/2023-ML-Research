Compares tradeoffs between machine learning methods and a [taylor series approximation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TaylorSeries.html]) when determining the perturbed interatomic potential of diatomic molecules. 

ML methods: KRR, SVR, NN (MLPRegressor)
Models unperturbed potential using following analytic methods: Morse, Hulburtâ€“Hirschfelder (HH), & Lennard-Jones (LJ)
